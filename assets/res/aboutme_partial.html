      <td class="description">Been programming since university. Interned a few times, did course projects, and dabbled in a few side-projects. Most of the side-projects I did during that time are actually at <a href="https://github.com/denisli" target="_blank">this GitHub profile</a>. I was super smart (/s) and kept that linked to my university email, which I have since lost access to.</td>
